Each respondent is assigned\n     an unique value of DOEID.  It can be used to merge data from one file\n     with data from another file.\n\n     Minimum Value: 1,001\n\n     Maximum Value: 5,852\n\nNWEIGHT 'The Final Weight'                                  Columns 6-11\n     Included in all files\n     Numerical Variable\n     Variable length: 6\n\n     Minimum Value:   5,594\n     Maximum Value: 105,485\n\n          The sample design for RECS is not a simple random sample.\n     Consequently, to estimate the number or percent of households/housing units\n     with a certain characteristic, the sampling weight should be used.  The\n     variable NWEIGHT is the sampling weight for the observation.  It is\n     approximately the inverse of the probability of selection.  It gives\n     the number of households that the response represents in the sample. \n     For most categorical variables, the codebooks contain both the\n     unweighted frequency and the weighted frequency.  The unweighted\n     frequency gives the number of observations, the weighted frequency\n     gives survey estimate of the number of households/housing units for\n     each possible value of the variable.  The weighted frequencies are\n     rounded to the nearest 100,000 households.  This is the limit of the\n     accuracy for RECS.  When the unweighted frequency is less than 10 or\n     the weighted frequency is less than 150,000; then weighted frequency is\n     suppressed.  A 'Q' is placed in the frequency to denote that the number\n     is suppressed.  This indicates that there are too few observation upon\n     which to determine an accurate estimate.\n\n\nMQRESULT 'Mail Questionnaire Codes'                         Columns 13\n     Included in all files\n\n     Categorical Variable \n     Variable length 1\n\n     Mail Questionnaire (MQ)\n     Authorization Form (AF)\n     Personal Interview (PI)\n\n     1 = MQ Completed, AF Signed\n     2 = MQ Completed, AF not required\n     3 = MQ Completed, AF Not Signed\n     7 = MQ returned after a PI was completed\n     8 = PI was completed after MQ was returned\n     9 = Not Applicable\n\n               Number         Weighted\n               Of             Number of\n     Value     Observations   Households\n     1            166          3,900,000\n     2              1                  Q\n     3             76          1,700,000\n     7             42          1,000,000\n     8             24            600,000\n     9          4,513         99,800,000\n\n     Q = Data withheld because fewer than 10 observation in the category.\n\n          When MQRESULT equals 1 2, or 3, the household and housing unit data\n     was not obtained via a personal interview.  The data were obtained using a\n     shortened mail questionnaire.  A hot-deck imputation procedure was used\n     to match each mail respondent to a personal interview respondent.  The\n     critical matching variables were FUELHEAT, FUELH2O, TYPECOOL, TYPEHUQ,\n     and REGIONC.  Additional  variables used in a scoring function to\n\n\n     determine the best match were MONEYPY, NHSLDMEM, VEHICLES, HHAGE, and\n\n     TOTROOMS.  The remaining household/housing unit characteristics for the\n     mail respondents were determined by the values of the matched personal\n     interview respondent.  The energy consumption and expenditures data for\n\n     the mail respondents was based upon data obtained from their energy\n     suppliers.  It was not imputed using a hot deck procedure.\n\n          Questionnaire data from personal interview respondents sometime is\n     missing and needs to be imputed.  'Z' variables are used to indicate\n     the presence of imputed data.  For example, if ZURBRUR = 0 then URBRUR\n     was not imputed.  If ZURBRUR = 1 then URBRUR was imputed.\n\n\nCensus Division/Region:   A geographic area consisting of several States\ndefined by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.
